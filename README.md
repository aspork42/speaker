Smart Speaker for DIY Home Automation 

This is based on software by Mr DIY's "Notifier" project. I have modified it to include a status LED and created a PCB and enclosure for a 3" speaker.

This can be used to play a sound when doors are opened, faucets are left running, water is found flooding the basement or to play nursery rhymes in the kids room at night.

This uses a D1 Mini WIFI module, an Adafruit MAX 98357A I2S Audio DAC & amplifier, and a custom PCB.
